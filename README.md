# GimmeThaHosts

A small script that helps you build a custom `/etc/hosts` file to block unwanted domains for privacy, security, or focus.

In simple terms:  
👉 it collects domain lists from multiple sources,  
👉 applies your allow/block rules,  
👉 and generates a ready-to-use hosts file — safely and reproducibly.

You stay in control of **what gets blocked and what doesn’t**.

---

## How it works (very briefly, non-technical)

-   Downloads domain lists from the sources you choose
    
-   Keeps local archived copies so things still work offline
    
-   Applies your personal allowlist and blocklist
    
-   Produces a clean `hosts` file
    
-   Asks before touching your system file
    

No magic, no background services, no telemetry.

## Configuration files (important)

This project is intentionally **opinionated for my personal needs**.  
You **must review and change these files** to match *your* setup.

### `sources.txt`

A list of blocklist sources (URLs or local files).

⚠️ **Important warning**  
My source list includes **very aggressive / extreme blocklists**.  
They **will break major services**, including (but not limited to):

-   Social media platforms
    
-   Messaging apps
    
-   CDNs used by popular websites
    
-   Some app update servers
    

This is **by design for my use case**, not a recommendation.  
If you don’t want things to break — **replace these sources**.

---

### `whitelist.txt`

Domains you explicitly **allow**.

-   Only exact matches are whitelisted
    
-   Subdomains are **not** automatically allowed
    
-   Useful when a blocklist is too aggressive
    

This file reflects *my* tolerances — yours will differ.

---

### `blacklist.txt`

Domains you explicitly **block**, regardless of sources.

-   Highest priority
    
-   Always applied first
    
-   Useful for adding personal rules
    

Again: customize freely.

---

### `hosts.header.txt`

The static header portion of the hosts file.

-   Localhost entries
    
-   IPv4 / IPv6 defaults
    
-   OS-specific lines if needed
    

Replace or edit this if your system requires something different.
